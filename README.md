# hate-speech-discord-bot
Are you looking to eradicate hate speech in your Discord server? Referencing a pre-trained Bert model (see README), this code customizes a bot that deletes inappropriate messages and warns users. It also allows them to play with fun cat, dog, and Roblox features. This not only makes the bot a responsible moderator, but also fun to interact with!
